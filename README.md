# OSPF-ROUTING

Network Project: Optimised Routing & Diagnostics 
 Specifically, this project was to develop a multi-router network operating under OSPF routing protocol of communication.
 Here's a breakdown of my key contributions 
 
 Network Design: 
 
 Defined a solution in terms of multiple router network architecture given the diagram above. 
 Advised every subnet to be allocated unique IP addresses to enable them to communicate. 
 Router Configuration: 
 
 This OSPF neighbor was an important one since I assigned the last four digits of my student ID to be used as router IDs. (Example: The name designations for students for routers are as follows: Student ID 1234 =Router IP address, (1. 0. 1. 4). 
 Enabled OSPF protocol for routers so as to allow automated way of getting routes and selecting the best route. 
 Ascertained OSPF neighborship using the command “show ip ospf nei” to confirm router interaction and establish working OSPF neighborship on OSPF-enabled routers. 
 PC Configuration: 
 
 Set up static IP addresses, subnet masks and default gateways of all the user PCs as shown in the above network diagram. 
 Set up the Server PC which was provided to the class as the DNS server for Internet connection. 
 Testing and Verification: 
 
 Accessed internet and OSPF routing by browsing the website “www. ilac. com” from User-1, User-2 and User-100. 
 This shows that OSPF has the capability of adjusting to changes in the network and at the same time, ensure the circuit is totally utilized. 
 Overall, this project showcases my skills in:Overall, this project showcases my skills in: 
 
 Standard and enhanced VLAN’s, OSPF routing and VTP. 
 Configuration of routers using identification numbers in order to ascertain the cause of a problem. 
 PC configuration for connection to the corporate network and to the WWW environment. 
 Check OSPF neighbor so as to confirm the proper functioning of routing protocol. 
 Using OSPF for routing and interconnecting to the internet.
